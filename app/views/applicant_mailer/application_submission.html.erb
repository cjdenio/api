<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>
Your application to start a <%= link_to 'Hack Club', 'https://hackclub.com/' %> at <%= @application.high_school_name %>
has been submitted for review.
</p>

<p>
There are 4 steps to joining Hack Club:
<ol>  
  <li>Apply <i>(you did this already!)</i></li>
  <li><b><%= link_to 'Join Slack', 'https://hackclub.com/slack/' %></b> <i>&lt;&mdash; (you are here)</i></li>
  <li>Onboarding Call</li>
  <li>First Meeting!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If you haven’t yet, <%= link_to 'join our Slack!', 'https://hackclub.com/slack/' %> It’s a Discord-like chatroom, active 24/7, of 10k+ Hack Clubbers around the world.
If your application gets accepted, you’ll be invited to the private channel just for club leaders.
</p>

<p>
Normally we respond to applications within a week. However, we are still busy preparing systems for the new year at HQ. 
As a result <b>we do not expect to begin admitting or onboarding clubs until August 30th.</b> 
Expect a proper response by the end of August; in the meantime, we encourage you to begin preparing your club! 
If we accept your application this will give you a valuable head-start. 
If we do not accept your application, we are likely to reconsider if you demonstrate progress such as signups, marketing campaigns, or actual meetings.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please
email us at <%= mail_to 'applications@hackclub.com' %>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br />
Hack Club
